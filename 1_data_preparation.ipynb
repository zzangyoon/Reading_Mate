시간이 걸렸기 때문이다. 집은 벽 네 개와 바닥, 지붕으로 이루어진 단 하나의 방뿐이었다. 그 방 안에는 낡은 요리용 난로, 식기들이 들어 있는 찬장, 탁자, 의자 몇 개, 그리고 침대들이 있었다. 헨리 아저씨와 엠 아주머니는 방 한쪽 구석의 큰 침대를 쓰고, 도로시는 다른 구석의 작은 침대를 썼다. 다락방은 없었고, 지하실이라고 해봐야 작은 구멍 하나가 전부였다. 그곳은 ’사이클론 지하실’이라 불렸는데, 거대한 회오리바람이 불 때 피할 수 있도록 만든 곳이었다. 바닥 가운데 있는 함정문을 열고 사다리를 타고 내려가면 그 어둡고 좁은 구멍으로 들어갈 수 있었다. 도로시가 문앞에 서서 밖을 바라보면 사방으로 회색빛 평원만이 끝없이 펼쳐져 있었다. 나무도, 집도 보이지 않았다. 태양은 밭을 잿빛 덩어리로 굳게 말려버렸고, 땅에는 작은 균열이 여기저기 나 있었다. 풀조차도 태양에 말라버려 초록빛을 잃고 회색빛을 띠고 있었다. 한때는 집에도 페인트가 칠해져 있었지만, 태양이 그 페인트를 벗겨내고 비가 그것을 씻어버려, 이제 집은 다른 모든 것처럼 칙칙하고 회색빛이었다. 엠 아주머니가 이곳에 처음 왔을 때는 젊고 예쁜 아내였다. 하지만 태양과 바람은 그녀의 눈빛에서 반짝임을 빼앗아가고, 그녀의 뺨과 입술에서 붉은 기운을 사라지게 만들었다. 이제 그녀의 얼굴은 말랐고, 표정은 굳어버려, 웃는 일이 거의 없었다. 도로시는 부모를 잃은 고아였는데, 처음 이 집에 왔을 때 그녀가 웃는 소리를 듣고 엠 아주머니는 심장이 멎을 만큼 놀랐었다. 지금도 도로시의 웃음소리를 들을 때마다 신기해했다. 헨리 아저씨는 한 번도 웃지 않았다. 그는 새벽부터 밤까지 일했고, 즐거움이 무엇인지 몰랐다. 그의 수염부터 부츠까지',
